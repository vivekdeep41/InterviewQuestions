Key differences between Promises and Observables:

1)-Handling Multiple Values:

Promises represent a single value (fulfilled or rejected).
Observables represent a stream of multiple values over time.

2)-Chaining Operations:

Promises chain using .then() and .catch() methods.
Observables chain using operators like .map(), .filter(), .mergeMap(), etc.

3)-Cancellations:

Promises do not have built-in cancellation support.
Observables support cancellations through unsubscribing.

4)-Flexibility and Operators:

Observables provide a wide range of operators to transform, filter,
 and manipulate data streams.
