RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a powerful library for handling 
asynchronous operations and working with data streams in JavaScript and 
Angular applications. It's an essential part of the Angular ecosystem and
 provides a functional and reactive programming paradigm. RxJS is used 
 extensively to manage events,asynchronous data, and state changes in Angular applications.

1)-Observables:

Observables represent a stream of values that can be emitted(जो समय के साथ उत्सर्जित होते हैं। ) over time.
They can emit any type of data, including numbers, strings, objects, or even events.
You can create observables from various sources, such as arrays, events, timers,
 or custom sources.

2)-Operators:

Operators are functions that allow you to manipulate, transform, and combine observables.
They are used to perform tasks like filtering values (filter), transforming values (map), 
merging multiple observables (merge), or switching to a new observable when another emits 
(switchMap).Operators are "chained" together to create complex data processing pipelines.

3)-Subjects:

Subjects are a type of observable that acts as both a producer (emitter) and
 a consumer (observer) of values.
They are commonly used for event handling, inter-component communication, and 
sharing data between components.
Subjects come in different flavors, such as Subject, BehaviorSubject, and ReplaySubject.

4)-Subscriptions:

A subscription is an object that represents the connection between an observer and 
an observable.
When you subscribe to an observable, you receive a subscription that you can use
 to unsubscribe when you're done consuming values.
Unsubscribing is important to prevent memory leaks when components are destroyed.

5)-Async Pipe:

The async pipe is a convenience feature in Angular templates that automatically 
subscribes to an observable and manages the subscription lifecycle.
It's commonly used to directly bind observables to the template for rendering dynamic
 data without manually managing subscriptions.

6)-HTTP Requests:

The HttpClient module returns observables for making HTTP requests in Angular applications.
You can chain operators to transform responses, handle errors, and process data before 
using it in your application.

7)-Event Handling:

RxJS is used for handling UI events in a more controlled and functional manner.
For example, you can debounce user input to prevent frequent requests, 
throttle actions to limit the frequency of event emissions, and combine multiple
 events with operators like merge and combineLatest.

8)-State Management:

RxJS is foundational for state management in Angular applications, especially with
 libraries like NgRx.
In state management, observables are used to represent and manage the application's 
data and state changes in a reactive and predictable way.

10)-Error Handling:

Operators like catchError and retry help you handle errors emitted by observables.
You can provide fallback values, handle errors gracefully, and even retry failed operations.

11)-Hot vs. Cold Observables:

A cold observable starts emitting values only when a subscription is made.
A hot observable emits values regardless of whether there are subscribers at the moment.
Examples of hot observables include mouse clicks, timers, and WebSocket connections.
